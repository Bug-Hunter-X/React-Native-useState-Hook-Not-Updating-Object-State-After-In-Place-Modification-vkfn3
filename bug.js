This error occurs when using the useState hook in React Native with an object as the initial state. If you directly modify the state object using methods like push or splice, React won't detect the change and re-render the component. This is because these methods modify the object in place, rather than creating a new object.

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [items, setItems] = useState([{ id: 1, name: 'Item 1' }]);

  const addItem = () => {
    items.push({ id: 2, name: 'Item 2' }); // Incorrect: Modifies the object in place
    setItems(items); // React won't detect the change
  };

  return (
    <View>
      {/* ... */}
      <Button title="Add Item" onPress={addItem} />
    </View>
  );
};
```
