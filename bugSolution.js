The correct way to update the state object is to create a new object with the updated values, which is achieved using the spread operator (`...`).

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [items, setItems] = useState([{ id: 1, name: 'Item 1' }]);

  const addItem = () => {
    setItems([...items, { id: 2, name: 'Item 2' }]); // Correct: Creates a new object
  };

  return (
    <View>
      {/* ... */}
      <Button title="Add Item" onPress={addItem} />
    </View>
  );
};
```

This ensures that React detects the state change and re-renders the component accordingly.
